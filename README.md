# Data-Analytics-Projects

This is a collection of data analytics and data science projects I have completed both independently and through Coursera's online learning platform.

Project 1: Business Metrics

In this project I identified a relevant business metric, days inventory, and described how studying that metric could lead Egger Consulting to produce a profitable business process change in their company.

Project 2: Economic Indicators

In this project I created dataframes showing gdp and unemployment data in python. Then I created a dashboard that visualized how changes in gdp impact the unemployment rate.

Project 3: Predicting Housing Prices

In this project I analyzed and predicted housing prices through attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms and number of floors. I created a dataframe containing the housing data and created a statistical summary of the data in python. I also cleaned the data by filling in missing values and dropping unnecessary columns from the dataframe. I also created a boxplot and scatterplot of the dataframe to visualize the data. Finally, I also fit a linear regression model to the data and calculated the R^2 value to see how well the attributes I chose predict housing prices.

Project 4: Data Visualization

In this project I created two visualizations in python. One was a bar chart summarizing the results of a survey conducted to gauge an audience interest in data science topics. The other was a chloropleth map of the crime rate in San Francisco.

Project 5: SQL Data Science Project

In this project I worked with three datasets: Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago, Chicago Public Schools and Chicago Crime Data. First I uploaded the csv data into the IBM's DB2 database management system. Then I performed queries and sub queries to access attributes of the relational databases in python's juptyer notebook environment.
