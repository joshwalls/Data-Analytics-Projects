# Data-Analytics-Projects

This is a collection of data analytics and data science projects I have completed both independently and through Coursera's online learning platform.

Project 1: Business Metrics

In this project I identified a relevant business metric, days inventory, and described how studying that metric could lead Egger Consulting to produce a profitable business process change in their company.

Project 2: Economic Indicators

In this project I created dataframes showing gdp and unemployment data in python. Then I created a dashboard that visualized how changes in gdp impact the unemployment rate.

Project 3: Predicting Housing Prices

In this project I analyzed and predicted housing prices through attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms and number of floors. I created a dataframe containing the housing data and created a statistical summary of the data in python. I also cleaned the data by filling in missing values and dropping unnecessary columns from the dataframe. I also created a boxplot and scatterplot of the dataframe to visualize the data. Finally, I also fit a linear regression model to the data and calculated the R^2 value to see how well the attributes I chose predict housing prices.

Project 4: Data Visualization

In this project I created two visualizations in python. One was a bar chart summarizing the results of a survey conducted to gauge an audience interest in data science topics. The other was a chloropleth map of the crime rate in San Francisco.

Project 5: SQL Data Science Project

In this project I worked with three datasets: Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago, Chicago Public Schools and Chicago Crime Data. First I uploaded the csv data into the IBM's DB2 database management system. Then I performed queries and sub queries to access attributes of the relational databases in python's juptyer notebook environment. 

Project 6: Coronavirus Dataset Research Project

In this project I used a dataset of coronavirus indicators I downloaded from kaggle.com. Then I utilized a python 3 environment to clean the dataset for missing values and formatting errors that would hinder my analysis. After that I did exploratory analysis on the data to try to answer the question: what factors influence daily death increase of coronavirus. Finally, the final product of this project was a linear regression model that showed a strong relationship between daily death increase and my chosen independent variables. I have included more notes embedded in the project that detail my thought process and how I came up my model. 

Project 7: Tableau Data Analysis Project

In this project I used data from Dognition to recommend business process changes to increase completed tests. I created a storypoint in tableau that included bar charts, line charts and dashboards to supplement my recommendations to Dognition. You can find my recommendations in the file entitled Tableau Analysis project and my Tableau storypoint under the file Dognition Recommendations.
