# Data-Analytics-Projects

This is a collection of data analytics and data science projects I have completed both independently and through Coursera's online learning platform.

Project 1: Economic Indicators

In this project I created dataframes showing gdp and unemployment data in python. Then I created a dashboard that visualized how changes in gdp impact the unemployment rate.
